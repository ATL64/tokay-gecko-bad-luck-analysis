# tokay-gecko-bad-luck-analysis

Context:

In my travels around Thailand I encountered some fascinating animals called "Tokay Geckos".  
These majestic creatures make a sound - their mating and territorial call- that resembles "to-kay", hence their name.
You can hear examples of this sound here:

I learned by talking with the locals (and you can find it mentioned in the video as well), that there is a superstition around
these mating calls:  If the gecko calls 7 times, it's bad luck.

I was quite happy with my newly acquired superstition, but given my fascination around the structure of pseudoscientific
beliefs, something in the back of my head kept bothering me.  I had never actually counted the amount of times geckos were calling,
but intuitively I would have guessed that 7 calls was not a rare occurrence.  If 7 was not a rare occurrence, would this 
superstition make any sense? 

Let me explain.  In general, omens of good or bad fortune have the feature of rareness, i.e. it must be somewhat
uncommon to encounter.  Otherwise you would be having signs of good and bad luck all the time.  Clearly, it would be an ontological catastrophe to have good and bad luck coexist simultaneously.
So the question had to be asked:  Is hearing 7 calls from a Tokay Gecko a rare occurence?

In order to answer this question, I decided to go on a quest of writing down the counts every time I could.
I built the data set you can find in the csv file.  It contains date/time (I started to record this half way through), the call counts, and whether the gecko was in my house or outside.
